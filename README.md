## Requirements
Solr 4.10.2
Solarium only supports PHP 5.3 and up.
It's highly recommended to have Curl enabled in your PHP environment. However if you don't have Curl available you can
switch from using Curl (the default) to another client adapter. The other adapters don't support all the features of the
Curl adapter.

##What is Solr?
Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

## What is Solarium?

Solarium is a PHP Solr client library that accurately model Solr concepts. Where many other Solr libraries only handle
the communication with Solr, Solarium also relieves you of handling all the complex Solr query parameters using a
well documented API.
